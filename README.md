<article>
    <ul>
        <li>in the first steps of our project we didnt work we create a prototype which in no autonome so controled the robot through a <b>joytstick</b></li>
        <li>we implemented 4 sensors <b>humidity- Temperature- CO2 and the battery of energie</b> and we supervise all their values in real-time with on the application</li>
        <li>streaming in real time : watching the area where the robot navigate remotely</li>
        <li>Add robot to data-base by the user and manage its data</li>

        <li>we worked more to automate the functionalities</li>
        <li>we keep the main options represented in the V1 section</li>
        <li>the app can monitore the state of the mapping doing by the robot in real-time and with hight precisions</li>
        <li>show the map outcome after the mapping</li>
        <li>the user can save the map by his supervision</li>
        <li>we reset the mapping and fix some issues </li>
